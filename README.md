🏗 Construction Site HIRA Assessment Dashboard for Industrial Health and Safety 

***Disclaimer: Proposed by a Construction Developer, this project was actually paid for and the data is from my client directly. The project is based on actual construction site safety data and has been anonymized for demonstration purposes. The original, complete Excel dataset will be available on request. The Dashboard contains only those sections which were demanded by the client.***

This repository contains a Hazard Identification and Risk Assessment (HIRA) analysis for a construction site, including a fully interactive Excel dashboard to visualize hazard risk levels, KPIs, and top risk activities.

📊 Features

Comprehensive HIRA Table – Hazard Type, Hazard Description, Controls, Severity, Likelihood, Risk Score.

Interactive Dashboard – Displays:

Top 8 high-risk activities

Top 10 hazards by risk score

Risk Matrix (Severity × Likelihood)

KPI metrics (e.g., total workers, hazard count, project completion status)

Color-coded Risk Levels – Quick visual identification of critical hazards.

Linked Hazard Categories – From electrical safety to working at heights.
